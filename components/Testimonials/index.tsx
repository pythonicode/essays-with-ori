          Oriana always got back to me with comments in a timely manner and I liked having her
          suggestions in Google Docs to look over later as I was revising my writing. She provides
          both notes on what is working well in the essays and what could be improved, which helped
          make my essays better while also giving me confidence during a stressful process. Sheâ€™s
          thorough in going through the details of my writing and helped me tell my story in a
          cohesive, articulated manner. I highly recommend having Oriana look over your college
          essays before applying.
