          Disclaimer: <br />I am not a professional admissions officer and never have been. While I
          provide the best advice I possibly can, have done extensive research on the college
          admissions process, and had lots of practice in the essay editing sphere, I cannot
          guarantee acceptance to any school, as that relies on a myriad of other factors as well
          and is, at least partially, random based on fit/luck/the admissions officers preferences.
          I can, however, guarantee you put your best foot forward in your essays, given that youâ€™re
          willing to put the work in to get to that point.
